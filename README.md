# Hex Keypad
A simple keypad for Arduino using Cherrry MX type key switches.<br>

The main idea was so I could test keyboard scan codes using an Arduino as a protocol converter.<br>

- Enter the two digit hex code, 00 to FF
- Press INVERT if you want to invert the entered hex value, i.e. ~0x12 = 0xED
- Press CLEAR if you make a mistake and want to reset the entry
- Press ENTER when the number is entered
- Press SEND to instruct the Arduino to send the scan code to the host computer
